## Travel Itinerary Core

Travel Itinerary is designed to be a full-stack, end-to-end travel planning experience with three tightly integrated layers:

- **Conversational AI Planner**: Users ask questions in natural language and receive streamed, context-aware travel recommendations. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground responses in actual place data.
- **Local Guide Content**: Contributors can add verified places through a guided form and map picker. New places are stored in PostgreSQL and indexed into Astra for instant retrieval.
- **Route Optimization Engine**: Selected places are turned into an optimized itinerary using OSRM road distances and a Branch-and-Bound solver, with multiple visualization layers highlighting the route decisions.

## Core User Workflow

1. User asks a travel question in the Planner.
2. Backend detects if query is place-related.
3. If place-related, query is embedded and matched in Astra vector DB.
4. Retrieved places are injected into a contextual prompt.
5. Nova streams the response back as NDJSON chunks.
6. User selects recommended places.
7. Route page loads selected place details and road-distance matrix.
8. Branch-and-Bound computes optimal visiting order.
9. Route is presented in graph, algorithm tree, and map flow views.

## Feature Modules

### 1) AI Planner (Streaming + RAG)

- Planner client sends message and recent chat history to `/api/chat/stream`.
- Route handler classifies query intent using travel/place keyword matching.
- Relevant queries trigger embedding generation and vector similarity search.
- Server streams AI output as NDJSON (`chunk`, `meta`, `done`, `error`).
- Client renders markdown incrementally and displays matched place sources.

_Example: Planner chat stream with RAG results on the right._

### 2) Local Guide Place Publishing

- Local guide page allows admins/contributors to submit new places.
- Coordinates can be chosen visually from an interactive map.
- Submission is stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma.
- The same place is embedded and indexed into Astra for future RAG retrieval.

_Example: Local Guide form for submitting a place with coordinates and category._

### 3) Route Planning + Optimization

- Selected places are shared via React Context between planner and route pages.
- Route page fetches full place details and builds graph nodes.
- Distance matrix is fetched from OSRM table endpoint (road distances between all points).
- Branch-and-Bound computes a minimum-cost route from selected start to end.
- Output is shown in:
  - Route graph (pairwise edge distances)
  - Live Branch-and-Bound tree (expanded/pruned/solution states)
  - Route flow map (ordered path segments)
  - OSRM distance table and network graph (for route feasibility checks)

## Route Visualization (Maps & Graphs)

Each visualization helps explain a different part of the route optimization pipeline.

### Route Flow Map

![Route Flow Map](public/screenshots/route-flow-map.png)
_Example: Route Flow Map showing the final ordered path on a Leaflet map._

This map is rendered in `app/route/components/RouteFlowMap.tsx`.
It renders the final itinerary path by fetching OSRM routing segments for each leg of the ordered route.
When OSRM returns invalid segments, the component falls back to straight-line connections while still showing the full route.

### Branch-and-Bound Tree

![Branch and Bound Tree](public/screenshots/branch-and-bound-tree.png)
_Example: Live Branch-and-Bound visualization showing explored and pruned branches._

This visualization is rendered in `app/route/components/BranchAndBoundTree.tsx`.
It shows each search node (partial route) as a tree node, with colors indicating:

- **Expanded** (active search)
- **Pruned** (discarded due to bound)
- **Solution** (best path found so far)

### OSRM Distance Table

![OSRM Distance Table](public/screenshots/osrm-distance-table.png)
_Example: OSRM distance matrix table used for route cost calculations._

This table is generated by `app/api/route/osrm-table/route.ts`.
It calls OSRM’s `/table` endpoint to compute road distances between all selected points, then validates results by comparing against straight-line distances so the optimizer avoids bad routing cases.

### OSRM Network Graph

![OSRM Network Graph](public/screenshots/osrm-network-graph.png)
_Example: OSRM network graph visualization used to validate road connectivity._

This graph view (rendered in `app/route/components/RouteGraph.tsx`) overlays the computed edge distances on a point graph.
Edges are annotated with distance labels, and the graph is used to help users understand why the optimizer chooses the route it does.

## Routing Algorithm (Moderate Technical View)

The route engine uses a Branch-and-Bound approach tailored for practical itinerary ordering:

- **State**: partial path, accumulated cost, optimistic lower bound
- **Branching**: expand next unvisited intermediate nodes
- **Bounding**: estimate best possible completion cost for each partial path
- **Pruning rule**: discard branches whose bound is already worse than current best
- **Search order**: best-first by smallest bound

Why this works well here:

- Exact enough for small/medium trip node counts
- Efficient due to aggressive pruning
- Easy to visualize for demos and explainability
